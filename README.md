# Daily-Side-Quest-Generator
The **Daily Side-Quest Generator** is an engaging productivity web application that transforms everyday life into a gamified RPG experience. The project aims to help users stay motivated, build positive habits, and make their routines more enjoyable. By blending the charm of role‑playing games with practical life tasks, the app turns mundane chores and healthy habits into exciting quests with XP rewards.

### Core Vision
The vision behind the application is to offer a lightweight yet meaningful daily companion that motivates users to take small, consistent actions. Instead of overwhelming to‑do lists, the app delivers a curated selection of fun, achievable quests every morning, encouraging gradual personal growth.

The app does **not** attempt to replace full task managers; instead, it focuses on boosting motivation through simplicity, randomness, and RPG-style rewards.
